Discoveryservice is a SAML IdP discoveryservice that:

- is a static html/javascript/css based service
- uses a compressed server generated static json document for info on the IdPs
- favors searching for IdPs by (domain)names and keywords
- can be used as a central or decentral service
- uses MDQ to get access to SP metadata for names and logos etc.
- has support for filtering of displayed IdPs eg. by federation
- is currently under development at WAYF and will be used as our primary disco service in the fall of 2016
